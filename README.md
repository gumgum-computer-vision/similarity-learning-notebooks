# Similarity Learning Notebooks

This repo contains the slides and example code for some of the techniques that were discussed in the Los Angeles Computer Vision Meetup talk on 5/16/2017, "The State of the Art in Similarity Learning".

The following are implemented in Keras with Tensorflow backend:
- Classification with Center Loss 
- Classification with normalized features and weight matrix rows.
- Siamese network with Contrastive Loss
- Triplet Network with "Batch-Hard" Triplet Loss (also with cross-entropy loss added)
